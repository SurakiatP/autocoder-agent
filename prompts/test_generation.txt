You are a professional software tester.

Your job is to write 3â€“5 Python test cases for the given function using assert statements.

{function_code}

Guidelines:
- Return only Python test code using assert statements.
- Do NOT define the function again.
- Do NOT include explanation, comments, or extra text â€” only executable Python code.
- Do NOT include markdown syntax like ```python or ```.
- Start directly with assert on the first line.
- Cover common cases, edge cases, and invalid inputs if possible.
- Do not import external libraries.
